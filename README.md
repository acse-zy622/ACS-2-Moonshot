Impact craters are the most ubiquitous surface feature on rocky
planetary bodies. Crater number density can be used to estimate the
age of the surface: the more densely cratered the terrain, the older
the surface. When independent absolute ages for a surface are
available for calibration of crater counts, as is the case for some
lava flows and regions of the Moon, crater density can be used to
estimate an absolute age of the surface.

Crater detection and counting has traditionally been done by laborious
manual interrogation of images of a planetary surface taken by
orbiting spacecraft
([Robbins and Hynek, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JE003966);
[Robbins, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JE00559)). However,
the size frequency distribution of impact craters is a steep negative
power-law, implying that there are many small craters for each larger
one. For example, for each 1-km crater on Mars, there are more than
a thousand 100-m craters. With the increased fidelity
of cameras on orbiting spacecraft, the number of craters visible in
images of remote surfaces has become so large that manual counting is
unfeasible. Furthermore, manual counting can be time consuming and
subjective
([Robbins et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2014.02.022)).
This motivates the need for automated crater detection and counting algorithms ([DeLatte et al., 
2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2019.07.017)).

Recent work has shown that widely used object detection algorithms
from computer vision, such as the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object
detection algorithm ([Redmon et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2016.91);
[Jocher et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4418161)), can be effective for crater detection on Mars
([Benedix et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EA001005); [Lagain et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001598)) and the Moon ([Fairweather
et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EA002177)).
